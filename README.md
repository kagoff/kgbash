#KGBASH
A simple command line shell that is similar but objectively worse than any real
shell found on an operating system.

## Features
    - Run any compiled executable (by default looks in $PATH directory)
    - Redirect input from file and output to file
    - Pipe commands to each other
    - Sleepable jobs

## Planned Improvements
    - Command history
    - Tab auto complete
    - Arrow key functionality (previous/next command, move cursor back)
